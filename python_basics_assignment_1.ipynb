        " - Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.\n",
        "   It is known for its design philosophy that emphasizes code readability,\n",
        "   notably using significant indentation. It supports multiple programming\n",
        "   paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Python is popular for a wide variety of purposes because it's simple,\n",
        "   versatile, and has a massive ecosystem of libraries. Some of the main areas\n",
        "   where Python shines are:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Data Science & Analytics - Used for analyzing data, building dashboards, and\n",
        "   performing statistical computations with libraries like Pandas, NumPy,\n",
        "   Matplotlib, Seaborn.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Machine Learning & AI - Core language for AI because of frameworks like\n",
        "   TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and its ease in handling large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Web Development - Web frameworks like Django and Flask make building websites\n",
        "   fast and scalable.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Automation & Scripting - Perfect for automating repetitive tasks like file\n",
        "   handling, web scraping, and report generation.\n",

        "- A Python interpreter is a program that executes Python code. Unlike a\n",
        "  compiler, which translates the entire source code into machine code before\n",
        "  execution, an interpreter reads the code line by line, translates it into\n",
        "  an intermediate form called bytecode, and then the Python Virtual Machine\n",
        "  (PVM) executes that bytecode. This line-by-line execution makes debugging\n",
        "  easier and allows for dynamic typing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "- Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in the Python language that have a\n",
        "  special meaning and purpose. They cannot be used as names for variables,\n",
        "  functions, or any other identifiers. Examples include if, else, for, while,\n",
        "  def, class, import, return, True, False, and None.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "- No, keywords cannot be used as variable names. Attempting to assign a value\n",

        "   For example, the following code is invalid:\n",

        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "- Mutability refers to whether an object's state or content can be changed\n",

        "\n",

        "- This is a fundamental design choice in Python that provides programmers with\n",
        "  two different types of sequence containers for different use cases.\n",
        "- Lists (list) are designed to be dynamic collections whose elements can be\n",
        "  frequently changed, added, or removed. Their mutability allows these\n",
        "  operations to be performed efficiently in-place without creating a new\n",
        "  list object for every modification.\n",
        "- Tuples (tuple) are designed to be fixed, unchangeable collections. Their\n",
        "  immutability offers several advantages:\n",
        "- Data Integrity: It ensures that the data within the tuple cannot be\n",
        "  accidentally altered.\n",
        "- Performance: Tuples are generally slightly faster and more memory-efficient\n",
        "  than lists.\n",
        "- Dictionary Keys: Because they are immutable, tuples are \"hashable\" and can\n",
        "  be used as keys in a dictionary, whereas mutable lists cannot.\n",

        "  \n",
        "Python has three logical operators:\n",
        "- AND: Returns True if both the left and right operands are true.\n",
        "- OR: Returns True if at least one of the operands is true.\n",
        "- NOT: Inverts the boolean value. It returns True if the operand is false, and  False if it's true.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "- Type casting (or type conversion) is the process of converting a variable\n",
        "  from one data type to another. This is done using built-in functions like\n",
        "  int(), float(), str(), list(), etc., which attempt to create a new object of\n",

        "- Implicit Type Casting (Coercion): This conversion is performed\n",
        "  automatically by the Python interpreter. When you perform an operation\n",
        "  involving two different data types, Python automatically converts the\n",
        "  smaller data type to the larger one to avoid data loss.\n",

        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "- The purpose of conditional statements (if, elif, else) is to control the\n",

        "  execute specific blocks of code only when certain conditions are met\n",
        "  (i.e., evaluate to True), enabling dynamic and responsive behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "- elif stands for \"else if\". It is used in an if-elif-else structure to check\n",
        "  for multiple conditions sequentially.\n",
        "  Python first checks the if condition. If it's True, its code block is\n",
        "  executed, and the entire structure is exited.\n",

        "  condition. If it's True, its block is executed, and the structure is exited.\n",
        "  This process continues for any subsequent elif statements.\n",
        "  If all if and elif conditions are False, the code block inside the optional\n",

        "- The main difference lies in how they determine the number of times to run.\n",
        "- for loop: A for loop is used for definite iteration. It iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or any other iterable object. You use it when you want to execute a block of code for each item in a collection or for a known number of times.\n",
