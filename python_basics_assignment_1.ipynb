        "1. What is python, and why is it popular?\n",
        " - Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.\n",
        "   It is known for its design philosophy that emphasizes code readability,\n",
        "   notably using significant indentation. It supports multiple programming\n",
        "   paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Python is popular for a wide variety of purposes because it's simple,\n",
        "   versatile, and has a massive ecosystem of libraries. Some of the main areas\n",
        "   where Python shines are:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Data Science & Analytics - Used for analyzing data, building dashboards, and\n",
        "   performing statistical computations with libraries like Pandas, NumPy,\n",
        "   Matplotlib, Seaborn.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Machine Learning & AI - Core language for AI because of frameworks like\n",
        "   TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and its ease in handling large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Web Development - Web frameworks like Django and Flask make building websites\n",
        "   fast and scalable.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Automation & Scripting - Perfect for automating repetitive tasks like file\n",
        "   handling, web scraping, and report generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Game Development - Used in lightweight game building with libraries like\n",
        "   Pygame.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking - Widely used for security tools, penetration\n",
        "   testing, and network analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Scientific & Research Applications - Preferred in academia for simulations,\n",
        "   bioinformatics, and mathematical modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "   IoT & Embedded Systems - Runs on microcontrollers using MicroPython and\n",
        "   CircuitPython.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   - A Python interpreter is a program that executes Python code. Unlike a\n",
        "     compiler, which translates the entire source code into machine code before\n",
        "     execution, an interpreter reads the code line by line, translates it into\n",
        "     an intermediate form called bytecode, and then the Python Virtual Machine\n",
        "     (PVM) executes that bytecode. This line-by-line execution makes debugging\n",
        "     easier and allows for dynamic typing.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in the Python language that have a\n",
        "    special meaning and purpose. They cannot be used as names for variables,\n",
        "    functions, or any other identifiers. Examples include if, else, for, while,\n",
        "    def, class, import, return, True, False, and None.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names. Attempting to assign a value\n",
        "    to a keyword will result in a SyntaxError.\n",
        "    For example, the following code is invalid:\n",
        "    # This will raise a SyntaxError\n",
        "      for = 5\n",
        "  \n",
        "  5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  - Mutability refers to whether an object's state or content can be changed\n",
        "    after it has been created.\n",
        "  - Mutable objects can be modified in-place after creation. Examples include\n",
        "    lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
        "    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "    my_list[0] = 100 # The original list object is changed\n",
        "    print(my_list) # Output: [100, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        " - Immutable objects cannot be modified after creation. Any operation that\n",
        "   ppears to modify them actually creates a new object. Examples include\n",
        "   integers, floats, strings, and tuples.\n",
        "   my_string = \"hello\"\n",
        "   my_string.upper() # This creates a new string \"HELLO\"\n",
        "   print(my_string) # Output: \"hello\" (the original is unchanged)\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        " - This is a fundamental design choice in Python that provides programmers with\n",
        "   two different types of sequence containers for different use cases.\n",
        " - Lists (list) are designed to be dynamic collections whose elements can be\n",
        "   frequently changed, added, or removed. Their mutability allows these\n",
        "   operations to be performed efficiently in-place without creating a new\n",
        "   list object for every modification.\n",
        " - Tuples (tuple) are designed to be fixed, unchangeable collections. Their\n",
        "   immutability offers several advantages:\n",
        " - Data Integrity: It ensures that the data within the tuple cannot be\n",
        "    accidentally altered.\n",
        " - Performance: Tuples are generally slightly faster and more memory-efficient\n",
        "   than lists.\n",
        " - Dictionary Keys: Because they are immutable, tuples are \"hashable\" and can\n",
        "   be used as keys in a dictionary, whereas mutable lists cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in Python?\n",
        " - == (Equality Operator): This operator compares the values of two objects.\n",
        "   It returns True if the objects have the same content.\n",
        "   list_a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   list_b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   print(list_a == list_b) # Output: True (values are the same)\n",
        "\n",
        "   is (Identity Operator): This operator compares the identity of two objects.\n",
        "   It returns True only if two variables point to the exact same object in\n",
        "   memory.\n",
        "   list_a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   list_b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   print(list_a is list_b) # Output: False (they are two different objects)\n",
        "\n",
        "  list_c = list_a\n",
        "  print(list_a is list_c) # Output: True (both point to the same object)\n",
        "\n",
        " 8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        " - Logical operators are used to combine or modify boolean expressions.\n",
        "   Python has three logical operators:\n",
        "  - and: Returns True if both the left and right operands are true.\n",
        "  - or: Returns True if at least one of the operands is true.\n",
        "  - not: Inverts the boolean value. It returns True if the operand is false,\n",
        "    and False if it's true.\n",
        "\n",
        " 9.What is type casting in Python?\n",
        " - Type casting (or type conversion) is the process of converting a variable\n",
        "   from one data type to another. This is done using built-in functions like\n",
        "   int(), float(), str(), list(), etc., which attempt to create a new object of\n",
        "   the specified type from the given value.\n",
        "   num_string = \"123\"\n",
        "   num_integer = int(num_string) # Casts string to integer\n",
        "\n",
        "   print(num_integer + 7) # Output: 130\n",
        "\n",
        "  10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  - Implicit Type Casting (Coercion): This conversion is performed\n",
        "    automatically by the Python interpreter. When you perform an operation\n",
        "    involving two different data types, Python automatically converts the\n",
        "    smaller data type to the larger one to avoid data loss.\n",
        "   result = 5 + 2.5 # Python implicitly converts the integer 5 to float 5.0\n",
        "   print(result) # Output: 7.5\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Explicit Type Casting: This conversion is performed manually by the\n",
        "   programmer using built-in functions. You explicitly tell the program to\n",
        "   convert a data type.\n",
        "   num_string = \"100\"\n",
        "   num_int = int(num_string) # Explicitly casting string to integer\n",
        "   print(type(num_int)) # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
        "\n",
        "  11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  - The purpose of conditional statements (if, elif, else) is to control the\n",
        "    flow of a program's execution. They allow the program to make decisions and\n",
        "    execute specific blocks of code only when certain conditions are met\n",
        "    (i.e., evaluate to True), enabling dynamic and responsive behavior\n",
        "\n",
        " 12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        " - elif stands for \"else if\". It is used in an if-elif-else structure to check\n",
        "   for multiple conditions sequentially.\n",
        "   Python first checks the if condition. If it's True, its code block is\n",
        "   executed, and the entire structure is exited.\n",
        "   If the if condition is False, Python proceeds to check the first elif\n",
        "   condition. If it's True, its block is executed, and the structure is exited.\n",
        "   This process continues for any subsequent elif statements.\n",
        "   If all if and elif conditions are False, the code block inside the optional\n",
        "  else statement is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        " 13.  What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        " - The main difference lies in how they determine the number of times to run.\n",
        "   for loop: A for loop is used for definite iteration. It iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or any other iterable object. You use it when you want to execute a block of code for each item in a collection or for a known number of times.\n",
        "   # Iterates through each fruit in the list\n",
        "     fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
        "     for fruit in fruits:\n",
        "     print(fruit)\n",
        "\n",
        "   while loop: A while loop is used for indefinite iteration. It continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains True. You use it when you don't know in advance how many times the loop needs to run.\n",
        "   # Runs until count is no longer less than 5\n",
        "     count = 0\n",
        "     while count < 5:\n",
        "     print(count)\n",
        "     count += 1\n",
        "\n",
        " 14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        " -  A while loop is more suitable in situations where the number of iterations  \n",
        "    is unknown and depends on a condition that might\n",
        "    change during execution.\n",
        "    Scenario: User Input Validation\n",
        "    A classic example is prompting a user for input until they provide a valid response. You don't know if the user will get it right on the first, second, or tenth attempt.\n",
        "    Keep asking the user for a positive number until they enter one.\n",
        "    user_input = \"\"\n",
        "    while not user_input.isdigit() or int(user_input) <= 0:\n",
        "    user_input = input(\"Please enter a positive number: \")\n",
        "    if not user_input.isdigit() or int(user_input) <= 0:\n",
        "        print(\"Invalid input. Please try again.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "        number = int(user_input)\n",
        "        print(f\"Thank you! You entered the positive number: {number}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this case, a for loop would be impractical because there's no sequence to iterate over; the loop's continuation depends entirely on the user's input.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
