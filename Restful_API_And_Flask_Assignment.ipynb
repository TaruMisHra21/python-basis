        "#1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "- A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to create, read, update, and delete resources, which are identified by URLs. It's a stateless protocol, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Example:** A client might send a GET request to /users/123 to retrieve information about the user with ID 123.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. Explain the concept of API specification.\n",
        "- An API specification (or definition) is a detailed document that describes how an API works. It serves as a contract between the API provider and its consumers, detailing the available endpoints, expected request formats (parameters, headers, body), response formats, status codes, and authentication methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Example:** An OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specification is a common format for defining RESTful APIs in a machine-readable way.\n",

        "#3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "**Flask** is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework. It is popular for building APIs because:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Simplicity and Minimalism:** It provides the essentials for web development without imposing a rigid structure, making it easy to learn and quick to get started with.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Flexibility:** It allows developers to choose the libraries and tools they want to use, giving them full control over the application's components.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Extensibility:** It has a rich ecosystem of extensions (like Flask-RESTful and Flask-SQLAlchemy) that can be easily integrated to add functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "- Routing in Flask is the mechanism that maps URLs to the specific Python functions that should handle them. When a user visits a URL in your application, Flask's routing system determines which view function to execute based on that URL pattern.\n",

        "- The url_for() function dynamically generates a URL for a specific view function. Instead of hardcoding URLs in your templates or code, you provide the name of the function, and url_for() builds the correct URL. This makes your application more maintainable, as changing a route in one place will automatically update all the links to it.\n",

        "#19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "HTTP status codes are standard three-digit codes returned by a server in response to a client's request. They are important because they quickly inform the client about the outcome of their request. Common codes include 200 OK (success), 201 Created (resource created), 404 Not Found (resource not found), and 500 Internal Server Error.\n",
        "\n",
        "#20.  How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "You handle POST requests by specifying methods=['POST'] in the @app.route() decorator and then accessing the incoming data (e.g., from a form or JSON body) using the request object inside your view function.\n",

        "#22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "Flask-RESTful is an extension that adds support for quickly building REST APIs. Its significance lies in its ability to simplify the creation of resources, handle request parsing, and provide a structured way to build API endpoints, often with less boilerplate code than using plain Flask.\n",
